> ðŸ“¢ NOTE: If your goal is to simply learn and play with TypeScript, which is what this repo was created to facilitate, **just use [Deno](https://deno.land/)** ðŸ¦•. Deno is a new JavaScript runtime that supports TypeScript out of the box, ships as a single executable, has built-in support for linting, formatting and testing, and offers even more!
